    "The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of freely available Python (http://www.python.org) tools for computational molecular biology. Python is an object oriented, interpreted, flexible language that is becoming increasingly popular for scientific computing. Python is easy to learn, has a very clear syntax and can easily be extended with modules written in C, C++ or FORTRAN.\n",

    "1. The ability to parse bioinformatics files into Python utilizable data structures, including support for the following formats:\n",
    "Blast output – both from standalone and WWW Blast\n",
    "    * Clustalw\n",
    "    * FASTA\n",
    "    * GenBank\n",

    "    * OP, including ‘dom’ and ‘lin’ files\n",
    "    * UniGen\n",
    "    * SwissProt\n",
    "2. Code to deal with popular on-line bioinformatics destinations such as:\n",
    " * NCBI – Blast, Entrez and PubMed services\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Tools for performing common operations on sequences, such as translation, transcription and weight calculations.\n",
